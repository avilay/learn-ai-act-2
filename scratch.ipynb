Every subsequent container start does not require me to specify the same params again. Lets say I run the image for the first time without any interactive terminals - `docker container run python`. This container will start and exit immediately, because there is no interactive terminal for the python REPL to run in. Now, lets say I run the image with the `-it` switch - `docker container run -it python`. As expected this will launch the REPL and the container will exit when I exit out of the REPL. However, now if I restart the second container without specifying any start params, without even the `-i` option like so - `docker container start `, the container will not exit. I won't have an interactive REPL, but the container will remain up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example of this run command memory is when I run the python image as a web server like so - `docker container run -p 8000:8000 python python -m http.server` and then stop the container. When I restart the container I don't have to specify the port setting again - `docker container start ` will automatically start the container with the original port mapping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third weirdness is with the way the `CMD` seems to be overridden. Lets say I run the python image but this time with the /bin/bash instead of the python REPL - `docker container run -it python /bin/bash`. After I exit out of the shell causing the container to exit, I can restart the container with the same overridden command without actually overriding the command again - `docker container start -i `. The container starts with /bin/bash instead of the default `CMD` of the image.\n",
