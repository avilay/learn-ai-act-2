       "CompletionResponse(text=\"Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc², which relates energy and mass.\\n\\nEinstein's work revolutionized our understanding of space and time, and he is considered the father of modern physics. He was a key figure in the development of quantum mechanics and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.\\n\\nEarly Life and Education:\\nAlbert Einstein was born in Munich, Germany to a middle-class Jewish family. His early interest in science and mathematics led him to study physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic University (now ETH Zurich), where he graduated in 1900.\\n\\nCareer:\\nEinstein worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland from 1902 to 1909, during which time he developed his theory of special relativity. In 1915, he expanded this theory to include gravity and introduced the concept of general relativity.\\n\\nIn the 1920s, Einstein turned his attention to quantum mechanics and the behavior of atoms and subatomic particles. His work on the photoelectric effect led to a deeper understanding of light and its interaction with matter.\\n\\nEinstein's Theory of Relativity:\\nHis theory of special relativity (1905) posits that time and space are relative and can be affected by an object's speed and position. The famous equation E=mc², derived from this theory, shows that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared.\\n\\nGeneral Relativity:\\nIn 1915, Einstein introduced general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. This theory predicted phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves, which were later confirmed by observations.\\n\\nAwards and Legacy:\\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Nobel Prize in Physics (1921), the Copley Medal (1925), and the Max Planck Medal (1929). He was also a prolific writer and public speaker, using his platform to advocate for peace, civil rights, and social justice.\\n\\nEinstein's legacy extends far beyond his scientific contributions. He inspired generations of scientists, philosophers, and thinkers around the world with his unique blend of creativity, curiosity, and intellectual rigor.\", additional_kwargs={'model': 'llama3', 'created_at': '2024-05-23T08:10:14.460667Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [128006, 882, 128007, 198, 198, 15546, 374, 17971, 469, 17194, 258, 30, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 198, 198, 67722, 55152, 220, 7, 9674, 24, 12, 6280, 20, 8, 574, 264, 6063, 12, 16381, 32887, 83323, 889, 374, 13882, 27458, 439, 832, 315, 279, 1455, 32549, 14248, 315, 279, 220, 508, 339, 9478, 13, 1283, 374, 1888, 3967, 369, 813, 10334, 315, 1375, 44515, 323, 279, 11495, 24524, 469, 28, 13183, 30556, 11, 902, 36716, 4907, 323, 3148, 13, 198, 198, 36, 37494, 6, 82, 990, 14110, 1534, 1057, 8830, 315, 3634, 323, 892, 11, 323, 568, 374, 6646, 279, 7126, 315, 6617, 22027, 13, 1283, 574, 264, 1401, 7216, 304, 279, 4500, 315, 31228, 30126, 323, 574, 22034, 279, 48078, 32293, 304, 28415, 304, 220, 5926, 16, 369, 813, 16540, 315, 279, 6685, 64465, 2515, 13, 198, 198, 42298, 9601, 323, 11930, 25, 198, 67722, 55152, 574, 9405, 304, 47304, 11, 10057, 311, 264, 6278, 12, 1058, 13653, 3070, 13, 5414, 4216, 2802, 304, 8198, 323, 38696, 6197, 1461, 311, 4007, 22027, 520, 279, 30791, 12411, 19294, 26522, 292, 3907, 220, 7, 3409, 38842, 72826, 705, 1405, 568, 33109, 304, 220, 7028, 15, 13, 198, 198, 91293, 25, 198, 36, 37494, 6575, 439, 264, 25589, 45357, 304, 14502, 11, 30221, 505, 220, 7028, 17, 311, 220, 7028, 24, 11, 2391, 902, 892, 568, 8040, 813, 10334, 315, 3361, 1375, 44515, 13, 763, 220, 7529, 20, 11, 568, 17626, 420, 10334, 311, 2997, 24128, 323, 11784, 279, 7434, 315, 4689, 1375, 44515, 13, 198, 198, 644, 279, 220, 5926, 15, 82, 11, 55152, 6656, 813, 6666, 311, 31228, 30126, 323, 279, 7865, 315, 33299, 323, 1207, 6756, 19252, 13, 5414, 990, 389, 279, 6685, 64465, 2515, 6197, 311, 264, 19662, 8830, 315, 3177, 323, 1202, 16628, 449, 5030, 13, 198, 198, 36, 37494, 6, 82, 31535, 315, 6649, 44515, 25, 198, 16366, 10334, 315, 3361, 1375, 44515, 220, 7, 7028, 20, 8, 1153, 1220, 430, 892, 323, 3634, 527, 8844, 323, 649, 387, 11754, 555, 459, 1665, 6, 82, 4732, 323, 2361, 13, 578, 11495, 24524, 469, 28, 13183, 30556, 11, 14592, 505, 420, 10334, 11, 5039, 430, 4907, 220, 7, 36, 8, 374, 6273, 311, 3148, 220, 7, 76, 8, 3115, 279, 4732, 315, 3177, 220, 7, 66, 8, 53363, 13, 198, 198, 15777, 6649, 44515, 25, 198, 644, 220, 7529, 20, 11, 55152, 11784, 4689, 1375, 44515, 11, 902, 16964, 24128, 439, 279, 83233, 315, 100108, 4199, 9057, 555, 11191, 6302, 13, 1115, 10334, 19698, 44247, 1778, 439, 3776, 20349, 323, 71019, 17301, 11, 902, 1051, 3010, 11007, 555, 24654, 13, 198, 198, 32, 4102, 323, 38987, 25, 198, 36, 37494, 4036, 12387, 23146, 323, 49593, 369, 813, 990, 11, 2737, 279, 48078, 32293, 304, 28415, 220, 7, 5926, 16, 705, 279, 356, 1184, 88, 17867, 220, 7, 5926, 20, 705, 323, 279, 7639, 9878, 377, 17867, 220, 7, 5926, 24, 570, 1283, 574, 1101, 264, 63100, 7061, 323, 586, 19114, 11, 1701, 813, 5452, 311, 29115, 369, 9096, 11, 8431, 3268, 11, 323, 3674, 12437, 13, 198, 198, 36, 37494, 6, 82, 20160, 2289, 3117, 7953, 813, 12624, 19564, 13, 1283, 14948, 22540, 315, 14248, 11, 61787, 11, 323, 69122, 2212, 279, 1917, 449, 813, 5016, 20955, 315, 28697, 11, 41328, 11, 323, 20207, 78477, 13, 128009], 'total_duration': 18386350666, 'load_duration': 14591500, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1871282000, 'eval_count': 495, 'eval_duration': 16496848000}, raw={'model': 'llama3', 'created_at': '2024-05-23T08:10:14.460667Z', 'response': \"Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.

      "Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of relativity and the famous equation E=mc², which relates energy and mass.\n",

      "\n",
      "Early Life and Education:\n",
      "Albert Einstein was born in Munich, Germany to a middle-class Jewish family. His early interest in science and mathematics led him to study physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic University (now ETH Zurich), where he graduated in 1900.\n",
      "\n",
      "Career:\n",
      "Einstein worked as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland from 1902 to 1909, during which time he developed his theory of special relativity. In 1915, he expanded this theory to include gravity and introduced the concept of general relativity.\n",

      "His theory of special relativity (1905) posits that time and space are relative and can be affected by an object's speed and position. The famous equation E=mc², derived from this theory, shows that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Relativity:\n",
